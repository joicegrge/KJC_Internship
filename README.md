Question : Create a Java application that manages student enrollments in courses using MongoDB. Use

structural differences. Upload the code to GitHub with the name Day3-Task
** Requirements
MongoDB Collections
students — stores student details
courses — stores course details

2. Add two types of enrollments (embedded and referenced).
3. Query and print both types with full details.
4. Update a student's name and mention the difference between updating a referenced
